# Demystify React Server Components

I([JSer](https://twitter.com/JSer_ZANP)) wanted to figure out how [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/react-18/server-components) works internally, so built this demo to have a guess at the implementation.

1.  ⚠️ This is just a demo of the rough ideas, only for learning purpose. It is NOT exactly how RSC actual works!
2.  I will dive into the actual implementation and put what learn on [React Source Code Walkthrough](https://jser.dev/series/react-source-code-walkthrough.html)

# About this demo.

I'll build the React Server Component demo from scratch with a few milestones to see the rationale behinde the idea. It should be easy to follow.

You can:

1. clone the repo and check out at target commit > `npm start` and there you go.
2. or just click the stackblitz link in below table.
